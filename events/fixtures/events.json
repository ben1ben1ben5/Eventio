Maybe you've wanted to market your business or yourself, or have an idea for an online-based startup? Let's meet and explore the fundamentals of programming! You'll learn how to write code, follow best-practices, and develop a mindset that will enable you to quickly learn new technologies. We will start by learning how the web works. We'll then learn programming basics by working with the HTML and CSS languages to create a simple website. From there, we'll learn how to store data in the \"cloud\" via databases, in order to create dynamic web applications that can process data. Finally, we'll learn how to make your code viewable to others by \"deploying\" to a web server. The type of website / application we build will be largely influenced by the interests of the attendees, in an effort to make the final product relevant to everyone who attends.", "start_time": "2016-10-27T00:00:00Z", "location": "Estes Park High School", "price": "500.00", "capacity": 20}}, {"model": "events.event", "pk": 2, "fields": {"name": "Hike Long's Peak", "description": "We're hiking Long's Peak!
